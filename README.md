Hii ! Im **Selin Alagoz. I am an electrical and electronics engineer.**                                                            
I am very curious and always try to learn new things.                                                                           

I am interested in **game development and pcb design.**
Sometimes I can be lost among the things I don't know like in this gif, but the important thing is to finally find the way :)

**I am trying to learn Altium Designer and Hardware Design engineering on electronics side.**
**On the game development side, I am currently working on unity and c#, but my main target is c++ and unreal.**


Thanks for your visit! See you later!
